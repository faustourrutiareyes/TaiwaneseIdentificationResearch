# Taiwanese Electorate and Self-Identification Analysis Project

This is a small research project aimed at finding a correlation between Taiwanese ethnic and political identification and preferred political party.

## Usage and Viewing

The files can be downloaded or cloned but will need Python, and Jupyter Notebook installed to run locally. Otherwise, all files can be viewed statically through Github with the main analysis viewable [here](main.ipynb).

## Disclaimer

This data was sourced from Academia Sinica's Center for Survey Research. Data from 2012, 2013 and 2014 was selected because for these three years there exists a category asking for respondent's self identification as either Taiwanese, Chinese, or both.

This project belongs to a wider analysis aiming to predict trends in Taiwanese election per city/county and clustering of Taiwanese electorate. Except for the input data which was converted from STATA format to .csv by one of my peers, whatever is submitted here is fully my contribution.
